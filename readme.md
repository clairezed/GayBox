## GayBox ?
GayBox is a prototype of connected object made during a two days workshop with [Atelier Objets Connect√©s](http://www.atelier-objets-connectes.org/) in Lyon, May 23-24 2015.
It was an excuse for us, with no experience in Internet of Things, to try a few basic technologies.

We ended with a box reacting in various ways at the appearance of #gay on twitter.
The box is build around a arduino board connected to a laptop running a python script checking twitter, through serial port.
The arduino board pilots rgb leds, a speaker, a lcd screen and a servo motor
